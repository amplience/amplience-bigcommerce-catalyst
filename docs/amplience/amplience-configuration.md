# Amplience Configuration

Main Amplience configuration is set through an environment variable.
You can set it locally in a `.env.local` file:

```
AMPLIENCE_HUBNAME=<dc hubname>
AMPLIENCE_HOMEPAGE_DELIVERY_KEY=<slot key for homepage>
```

Slot key is usually `homepage` in the case of Demostore automation.
